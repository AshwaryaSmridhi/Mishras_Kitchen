    <p class="review feedback1">"The best thing about Mishra's KItchen that you can order any dish as suitable for your taste. I ordered two butter chicken one mild for my kids and other one hot for me. Both were delicious, kids love it and i did. I am indian and I know my food, it was spot on, on time and tasty." - Rishi(December, 2015)</p>
    <p class="review feedback2">"We all enjoyed Mishra's Kitchen a great deal, our choices were diverse Meat & vegan, Vindaloo & children's mild dishes, with sides & chutneys, also we have food intolerance to preservatives, nuts & lactose, the full spectrum. It's not easy to "eat out" for our family, so this was special. All the dishes were fresh & vibrant in flavor, even my 3YO loved his first curry. Thanks Mishra's kitchen for your wonderful service."- Vicky(ZenBela, 2015)</p>
